If you cannot edit the checklist please:\r\n1. Make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account\r\n2. Be sure to accept the invite at this URL: https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/invitations\r\n\r\nThe reviewer guidelines are available here: https://joss.theoj.org/about#reviewer_guidelines. Any questions/concerns please let @leeper know.\r\n\r\n## Review checklist for @kbenoit\r\n\r\n### Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n- [x] As the reviewer I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/COI.md) and that there are no conflicts of interest for me to review this work.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [JOSS code of conduct](https://joss.theoj.org/about#code_of_conduct).\r\n\r\n### General checks\r\n\r\n- [x] **Repository:** Is the source code for this software available at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/evan-l-munson/SAoTD\">repository url</a>?\r\n- [x] **License:** Does the repository contain a plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) software license?\r\n    No, but many R packages using standard licenses only name the license in the `DESCRIPTION` file.  The `README.md` refers to \"All code is licensed GL\", this should be \"GPL-x\".  \r\n- [ ] **Version:** 0.2.0\n    No: GitHub release is 6 commits behind the master.  Master has v1.0.0.    \r\n- [x] **Authorship:** Has the submitting author (@evan-l-munson) made major contributions to the software? \r\n    Yes, apparently all.  \r\n- [x] Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?  \r\n    More than complete, as the 2nd through last author have an unknown contribution to the software.  They have not made any GitHub commits, and there is no record of them having authored any of the functions (for instance via `@author`).  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the function of the software can be verified?\r\n- [ ] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Authors:** Does the `paper.md` file include a list of authors with their affiliations?\r\n- [ ] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?  \r\n    No, the paper focuses more on what the package does than providing an explicit statement of need.  This could be made more clear (and at little cost or effort).  \r\n- [x] **References:** Do all archival references that should have a DOI list one (e.g., papers, datasets, software)?\r\n",

Instead, please create a new issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mrecos/klrfome\" target=\"_blank\">target repository</a> and link to those issues (especially acceptance-blockers) in the review thread below. (For completists: if the target issue tracker is also on GitHub, linking the review thread in the issue or vice versa will create corresponding breadcrumb trails in the link target.)\r\n\r\n## Reviewer instructions & questions\r\n\r\n@benmarwick, please carry out your review in this issue by updating the checklist below. If you cannot edit the checklist please:\r\n1. Make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account\r\n2. Be sure to accept the invite at this URL: https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/invitations\r\n\r\nThe reviewer guidelines are available here: https://joss.theoj.org/about#reviewer_guidelines. Any questions/concerns please let @leeper know.\r\n\r\n## Review checklist for @benmarwick\r\n### Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n- [x] As the reviewer I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/COI.md) and that there are no conflicts of interest for me to review this work.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [JOSS code of conduct](https://joss.theoj.org/about#code_of_conduct).\r\n\r\n### General checks\r\n\r\n- [x] **Repository:** Is the source code for this software available at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/mrecos/klrfome\">repository url</a>?\r\n- [x] **License:** Does the repository contain a plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) software license?\r\n- [x] **Version:** v2.2.0\n- [x] **Authorship:** Has the submitting author (@mrecos) made major contributions to the software? Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\nBM: I think Szabo should be noted in the readme as someone who made a contribution that made this pkg possible\r\nBM: done\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe package includes all the following forms of documentation:\r\n  \r\n- [x] **A statement of need** clearly stating problems the software is designed to solve and its target audience in README\r\nBM: very nicely stated.\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** for the development version of package and any non-standard dependencies in README\r\n- [x] **Vignette(s)** demonstrating major functionality that runs successfully locally\r\nBM: There is no vignette, but the README gives a very thorough walk-through. I think I've seen a method to have a vignette, and auto-extract it into the README on pkg build, that would help to fulfil this requirement.\r\nBM: done\r\n- [x] **Function Documentation:** for all exported functions in R help\r\nBM: documentation is present, but uneven. Descriptions and examples are missing for many functions. These should be added. Spelling: scaler should be scalar. The KLR function has a bit of commented-out code in it that probably should be removed. \r\nBM: done\r\n- [x] **Examples** for all exported functions in R Help that run successfully locally\r\nBM: not yet, though the readme is a good start. \r\nBM: done\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines** including contribution guidelines in the README or CONTRIBUTING, and DESCRIPTION with `URL`, `BugReports` and `Maintainer` (which may be autogenerated via `Authors@R`).\r\nBM: There is no 'Maintainer' field in description. The pkg referred to in the CONTRIBUTING is DistRegLMERR, presumably an earlier name for this pkg, but should be changed. \r\nBM: done\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Authors:** Does the `paper.md` file include a list of authors with their affiliations?\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [x] **References:** Do all archival references that should have a DOI list one (e.g., papers, datasets, software)?\r\n\r\n### Additional criteria (from rOpenSci)\r\nBM: I pasted these over from the rOpenSci onboarding\r\n - [x] **Packaging guidelines**: The package conforms to the rOpenSci packaging guidelines: https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/packaging_guide.md \r\n BM: not yet, still some documentation to add. There is no NEWS file. There are no tests. \r\nBM: done\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Unit tests cover essential functions of the package\r\nand a reasonable range of inputs and conditions. All tests pass on the local machine.\r\nBM: not yet. \r\nBM: done\r\n \r\n #### Final approval (post-review)\r\n \r\n - [x] **The author has responded to my review and made changes to my satisfaction. I recommend approving this package.**\r\n   \r\n   Estimated hours spent reviewing: \r\n   3\r\n   ---\r\n  \r\n  ### Review Comments\r\nThe author has done an excellent job of fulfilling the requirements for JOSS. In particular, it's an excellent example of superb package documentation to the point that I believe any undergraduate archaeology student (or related field) should be able to make sense of what is the need and purpose, and quickly start using the pkg. The vignette is outstanding and deserves a wide audience. Well done!\r\n",

If you cannot edit the checklist please:\r\n1. Make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account\r\n2. Be sure to accept the invite at this URL: https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/invitations\r\n\r\nThe reviewer guidelines are available here: https://joss.theoj.org/about#reviewer_guidelines. Any questions/concerns please let @biorelated know.\r\n\r\n  ### Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n- [x] As the reviewer I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/COI.md) and that there are no conflicts of interest for me to review this work.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [JOSS code of conduct](https://joss.theoj.org/about#code_of_conduct).\r\n\r\n### General checks\r\n\r\n- [x] **Repository:** Is the source code for this software available at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/xiangfstats/GenieR\">repository url</a>?\r\n- [x] **License:** Does the repository contain a plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) software license?\r\n- [x] **Version:** Does the release version given match the GitHub release (v1.0.0)?\r\n  \u26a0\ufe0f **TODO:** No github release exists. DESCRIPTION file lists version as 0.1.0. Please harmonize version numbering and create github release.\r\n- [x] **Authorship:** Has the submitting author (@xiangfstats) made major contributions to the software? Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\nInstallation works as described on the reviewers machine (Windows 10, R 3.4.2, Rtools 3.5)\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Suggestion:** It might be worth pointing out (for the benefit of Windows users - not sure what the target audience is likely using) that a C++ compiler / Rtools installation is necessary. See PR.\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the function of the software can be verified?\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Suggestion:** Automated tests are provided covering input checking. All of these appear to be 'negative tests' i.e. based on `expect_error()`. I'd suggest that the authors also implement tests that check the code provides correct output when provided with correct inputs.\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Authors:** Does the `paper.md` file include a list of authors with their affiliations?\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [ ] **References:** Do all archival references that should have a DOI list one (e.g., papers, datasets, software)?\r\n\r\n",
