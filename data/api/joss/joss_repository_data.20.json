Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\n\r\n_It is a smooth experience. As the authors stated, it might require a little more commitment for it to work on Windows. The anaconda tip is really helpful @jwbuurlage. Maybe there could be a brief statement (require Ubuntu as WSL) either in the paper or in gitlab for Windows users. This is a very minor point. It is up to the authors' preference._ \r\n\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n\r\n_Most of the functions work smoothly. I would appreciate it if the authors could list the performance data for some of the more time-consuming functions. Like for x MB 3D time series of x time points, running x function on a xxxxx platform usually takes xx sec/min. I see something similar in the comments of the tutorials. I want to point this out as:_\r\n\r\n_- This would be a great guide and provide proper expectations for new users._ \r\n\r\n_- This could also be a selling point for the software as it can be benchmarked against Numpy or Scipy._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n\r\n_I don't think so. But as mentioned above, it would be great if the authors could benchmark a few corresponding functions against Numpy or Scipy._\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n\r\n_The authors did a great job stating the general function of this software. As the software has a very general application with 2D and 3D images (sets), I would appreciate a little more details about the input data format requirement upfront (like only a single 3D TIFF per state file is supported for 3D images). It would be essential information the users want to see clearly at the very beginning that whether this tool is applicable to their data. And probably ways to convert image sets (especially for 3D) to acceptable format._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n\r\n_The examples in the tutorials and the gallery are really helpful and they all work._ \r\n\r\n_- As the author mentioned, there are a lot of defaults for the functions (which is always the case). I would appreciate it if the authors could point out key parameters that can be twisted for different purposes along with the examples. Or even better organizing parameter twisting as a separate part of the tutorial._  \r\n\r\n_- A very minor point, the axes of a few plots ([for example](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/tutorial-02b-DIC-practice.html)) in the tutorials and the gallery are really small. To my understanding, the axes don't matter for the illustration purpose of those plots. Would it be better to get rid of the axes labels then?_\r\n\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n\r\n_The authors have done a great job documenting the functionalities._ \r\n\r\n_- I would appreciate it if the '[tools provided](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/intro.html#tools-provided)' part can be separated out as itself in the main list (right now it is under intro). It would be easier for users to find and search._ \r\n\r\n_- Another point relates to the paper. It would be great if links to 'tools provided' (or even '[Gallery of examples](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/spam_examples/index.html)' could be provided there for each function toolkits. This would give the users an easier way to get to know the functions more straightforwardly and in more detail if they want to._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Summary:** Has a clear description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience been provided?\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n_As mentioned above, it would be great to mention the input format requirement upfront._ \r\n- [x] **State of the field:** Do the authors describe how this software compares to other commonly-used packages?\r\n_It would be easier to see and compare with the information packed into a table._\r\n- [x] **Quality of writing:** Is the paper well written (i.e., it does not require editing for structure, language, or writing quality)?\r\n\r\n_- As mentioned above, the toolkit section would be better if links to tutorials or the gallery could be provided._\r\n\r\n_- The 'Use in existing work' is great with the reference of which part is related. It would be better if the Figure number could also be provided to guide the readers._ \r\n\r\n- [x] **References:** Is the list of references complete, and is everything cited appropriately that should be cited (e.g., papers, datasets, software)? Do references in the text use the proper [citation syntax]( https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citation_syntax)?\r\n\r\n## Review checklist for @jwbuurlage\r\n### Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest (COI) policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/COI.md) and that: I have no COIs with reviewing this work or that any perceived COIs have been waived by JOSS for the purpose of this review.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [JOSS code of conduct](https://joss.theoj.org/about#code_of_conduct).\r\n\r\n### General checks\r\n\r\n- [x] **Repository:** Is the source code for this software available at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/ttk/spam/\">repository url</a>?\r\n- [x] **License:** Does the repository contain a plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) software license?\r\n- [x] **Contribution and authorship:** Has the submitting author (@edwardando) made major contributions to the software? Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\n\r\n_Edward And\u00f2 (@edwardando) appears to be the main contributor in terms of number of commits. All authors that have made code contributions to the software appear to be in the list of paper authors._\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\n\r\n_My Linux distributions (Fedora (rawhide)) was not in the list of supported operating systems, however:_\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconda create -n spam python=3.7\r\nconda activate spam\r\nmodule load mpi\r\npip install spam\r\nspam-ldic --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n_worked fine, and more or less coincided with the installation instructions given in the documentation. I would say the installation procedure is painless, and well documented._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n\r\n_The authors divide the functionality of the software in a number of toolkits. The list of toolkits (or at least how they are grouped together) differs between the software documentation and the article. I prefer the [list of toolkits of the software documentation](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/intro.html#tools-provided) over the list of toolkits given in the article, as the range of functionality is immediately clear. The list in the article is more exhaustive._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n\r\n_(I am not aware of any performance claims or benchmarks comparing the software with competing packages.)_\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n\r\n_[Yes](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/intro.html), although the first paragraph of that page may benefit from some additional sentences explaining some of the benefits and capabilities of the software._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n\r\n_If you happen to run an OS explicitly mentioned in the [installation page](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/installation.html#) then the installation instructions are clear. They do require installation of packages that is handled outside of the Python package manager, which I think is acceptable given the dependencies (in particular MPI). Some thoughts:_\r\n\r\n- _The documentation would benefit from a paragraph 'other Linux distributions' where a list of software dependencies is given. This allows users to easily locate the relevant packages from their distribution, instead of decyphering and translating the list of Ubuntu packages given in the example._\r\n- _The software could be given as a meta-package, with individual toolkits also published as their own packages. This would reduce the number of dependencies if only some of the toolkits need to be used. (I do not know in detail what the inter-dependencies are of the individual toolkits that are part of spam)._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n\r\n_Yes, there are elaborate tutorials that are well written. I encountered a broken link while following one of the tutorials (in the sentence \"calculate the strains coming from the measured displacement field of *this* example\"). One suggestion would be to include a download link to say a ZIP file of the datasets that are used in the tutorial at the beginning, so that you can download them once and then follow along._\r\n\r\n_The gallery of examples is excellent. I tried some on my system, and they all worked without fail._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n\r\n_Yes, the API methods is clearly documented. The API documentation is automatically generated and [available on the documentation page](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/py-modindex.html)._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?\r\n\r\n_[Yes](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/ttk/spam/pipelines), with acceptable coverage_.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n\r\n_[Contributions, yes](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/howToContribute.html). For issues or seeking support, I could only find a [link to a matrix.org chat room](https://ttk.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/spam/intro.html). I would suggest adding a section for reporting issues or filing requests._\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Summary:** Has a clear description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience been provided?\r\n\r\n_As someone with experience in the field of tomography, it is clear to me what the purpose of the software is, and that it fills an important void. However, I think the summary could benefit from giving some simple examples, in simple words, of 3D image measurement tasks that the software can perform._\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [x] **State of the field:** Do the authors describe how this software compares to other commonly-used packages?\r\n\r\n_Yes, but the section is short, and would benefit from one or two sentences about each software package and what the functionality overlap is between them and `spam`._\r\n\r\n- [x] **Quality of writing:** Is the paper well written (i.e., it does not require editing for structure, language, or writing quality)?\r\n\r\n_It is acceptable, but I do have a number of comments._\r\n\r\n- _My main critique is that the language is too colloquial in a number of places._\r\n- _There are some inconsistencies with font usage: some software packages are written using a monospace font, and some are not. I would indeed write NumPy over `numpy`, and some official spellings of software packages are all lowercase which complicates matters. However, why are `sphinx` and `unittest` monospace, but tifffile and meshio are not? I would double check all official spellings of packages, for example it is Git not git._\r\n- _Some of the links are not permalinks, and this is even sometimes explicitely marked as such ('currently available at')._\r\n\r\n- [x] **References:** Is the list of references complete, and is everything cited appropriately that should be cited (e.g., papers, datasets, software)? Do references in the text use the proper [citation syntax]( https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citation_syntax)?\r\n\r\n",
