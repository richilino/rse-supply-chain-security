See author's comment [below](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/3504#issuecomment-909157981) on performance\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n    - Problems being solved: \"responds to research needs by providing easy-to-use tools for scraping Finnish media articles and extracting the article texts from the scraped HTML files.\" \r\n    - The target audience for this project is those in media research who need access to this data. The python package itself is \"for the benefit of more computationally-savvy users\" and the \"Finish Computational Science community\".\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n    - These is an explicit list of dependencies in [poetry.lock](https://github.com/hsci-r/finnish-media-scrapers/blob/master/poetry.lock)\r\n    - The necessary dependencies are installed with `pip install`\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n    - [x] Members of Parliament Example: \r\n    - [x] Helsingin Sanomat\r\n    - [x] Yle\r\n    - [x] Iltalehti\r\n    - [x] Iltasanomat\r\n    - [x] fms-post-filter script\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?\r\n    - There are no automated tests due to the reliance on external APIs. Instead, any problems should show through logging. See author's explanation below.\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n    - I don't think there are clear guidelines aside from the fact that anyone can open a GitHub Issue. EDIT: this has been updated in commit __. In short, all support/contributions can be through GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Summary:** Has a clear description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience been provided?\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Does the paper have a section titled 'Statement of Need' that clearly states what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n    - Yes, there is a section titled 'Statement of Need'\r\n    - The types of problems are: media research\r\n    - The target audience is: researchers, Finnish computational science community\r\n- [x] **State of the field:** Do the authors describe how this software compares to other commonly-used packages?\r\n    - There are no named comparable packages, but the Statement of Need addresses the media research field which might use this package.\r\n    - EDIT: a Related work section has been added to the README.\r\n- [x] **Quality of writing:** Is the paper well written (i.e., it does not require editing for structure, language, or writing quality)?\r\n- [x] **References:** Is the list of references complete, and is everything cited appropriately that should be cited (e.g., papers, datasets, software)? Do references in the text use the proper [citation syntax]( https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citation_syntax)?\r\n\r\n## Review checklist for @pmyteh\r\n### Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest (COI) policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/COI.md) and that: I have no COIs with reviewing this work or that any perceived COIs have been waived by JOSS for the purpose of this review.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [JOSS code of conduct](https://joss.theoj.org/about#code_of_conduct).\r\n\r\n### General checks\r\n\r\n- [x] **Repository:** Is the source code for this software available at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/hsci-r/finnish-media-scrapers\">repository url</a>?\r\n- [x] **License:** Does the repository contain a plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) software license?\r\n- [x] **Contribution and authorship:** Has the submitting author (@jiemakel) made major contributions to the software?

Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\n- [x] **Substantial scholarly effort:** Does this submission meet the scope eligibility described in the [JOSS guidelines](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#substantial-scholarly-effort)\r\n    - Several commits, useful project to academic community studying finnish media, over 1000 LOC  of Python\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\n    - installed via pypi, installed easily\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n    - `--help` works as expected\r\n    - `fms-query-il` is broken it seems, rest of the tools work (I ran this command: `fms-query-{yle|hs|il|is} --from-date 2021-01-01 -q 'parliament' -l 10 -o results2.csv`). I got a `TypeError` for `-il`.\r\n    - did not check the other three components yet\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n    - Software's primary bottleneck is not burdening remote servers, therefore, there is a limit on how fast they can be. Regardless, as I understand it, this is a Python script designed more for convenience rather than performance or scalability. Therefore, I see no need for extra efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n    - A clear statement of need is given and target audience (Finnish HSRG) and problem statement (crawl Finnish media text) is given\r\n    - I think it is tradition to also compare one's work with other existing work in the field :-) It would be good to at least mention that no other existing software can possibly be repurposed to perform the same task with the same level of efficiency, as this project directly uses APIs and also extracts structured text, which other softwares will possibly not.\r\n    - There is a related work section in the README but I think a gist of it should still be mentioned in the paper.\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n    - `pip` is used to install as an end user and `poetry` as a developer, both are pretty standard.\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n    - Many examples, also an example `members_of_parliament` folder is available.\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n    - Simple flowchart plus explanatory statements are given.\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?\r\n    - Added a comment about this below (https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/3504#issuecomment-963320985)\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n    - lead author's email is provided for contact\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Summary:** Has a clear description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience been provided?\r\n    - Summary is probably too short and vague. The first step in this project is keyword search but it's not mentioned in the summary. Perhaps a line or two can be added about \"structured retrieval\" as well. I would begin with something like \"Finnish Media Scrapers is a package for retrieving articles in a structured form from Finnish Media websites. It allows flexible configuration in terms of start date/end date and/or keyword search.\" and then continue to explain what is meant by 1. retrieving articles 2. structured form 3. keywords 4. which media websites.\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Does the paper have a section titled 'Statement of Need' that clearly states what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [x] **State of the field:** Do the authors describe how this software compares to other commonly-used packages?\r\n    - See comment in previous section\r\n- [x] **Quality of writing:** Is the paper well written (i.e., it does not require editing for structure, language, or writing quality)?\r\n- [x] **References:** Is the list of references complete, and is everything cited appropriately that should be cited (e.g., papers, datasets, software)? Do references in the text use the proper [citation syntax]( https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citation_syntax)?\r\n",

Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\n- [ ] **Substantial scholarly effort:** Does this submission meet the scope eligibility described in the [JOSS guidelines](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#substantial-scholarly-effort)\r\n\r\nI believe that this check mark is what has been causing the delay for  both me and @rosecers. Unfortunately, when this paper was first submitted, the package was not well-documented and was hard to understand. We have asked for some clarification and code clean up. Unfortunately, I feel that even with the improvements this work does not meet the requirements of JOSS for substantial scholarly effort and I can't recommend this package for publication in JOSS at this time.\r\n\r\nJOSS defines the following for substantial scholarly effort:\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, JOSS\u2019 minimum allowable contribution should represent not less than three months of work for an individual. Some factors that may be considered by editors and reviewers when judging effort include:\r\n\r\n- Age of software (is this a well-established software project) / length of commit history.\r\n- Number of commits.\r\n- Number of authors.\r\n> This package has only one author.\r\n\r\n- Total lines of code (LOC). Submissions under 1000 LOC will usually be flagged, those under 300 LOC will be desk rejected.\r\n> While this submission appears to fit this criteria, upon closer inspection this is questionable. Many of the functions in `misc.py`, for example do not add any functionality that are not in Python already (for example \r\n\r\n> This package has many more lines of code than are needed to achieve its objective.  Many of the functions are what I would call light wrappers around other libraries and do not add much functionality themselves. Many functions (particularly in `misc.py` reimplement functionality that are already available in Python or have statements that are unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Whether the software has already been cited in academic papers.\r\n> The software has not been cited in academic papers\r\n\r\n- Whether the software is sufficiently useful that it is likely to be cited by your peer group.\r\n> I am not convinced of this point because the software is mostly thin wrappers around existing code.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately cannot recommend this software package for publication in JOSS at this time.
