Be sure to accept the invite at this URL: https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/invitations\r\n\r\nThe reviewer guidelines are available here: https://joss.theoj.org/about#reviewer_guidelines. Any questions/concerns please let @mgymrek know.\r\n\r\n\u2728 **Please try and complete your review in the next two weeks** \u2728 \r\n\r\n## Review checklist for @rmflight\r\n### Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n- [x] As the reviewer I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/master/COI.md) and that there are no conflicts of interest for me to review this work.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [JOSS code of conduct](https://joss.theoj.org/about#code_of_conduct).\r\n\r\n### General checks\r\n\r\n- [x] **Repository:** Is the source code for this software available at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR\">repository url</a>?\r\n- [x] **License:** Does the repository contain a plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) software license?\r\n  - No [license](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/2) file. It is licensed according to CRAN and Bioconductor standards, but not commonly accepted OSS project standards.\r\n  - This was resolved by [this commit](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/commit/1340208624961bf0a5ee142cb539b3d5099c08a9)\r\n- [x] **Version:** v1.1.2\n- [x] **Authorship:** Has the submitting author (@tothuhien) made major contributions to the software? Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?\r\n  - Yes, based on the git contributions, it seems the authors list is appropriate and complete.\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n- [x] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?\r\n  - Yes, installation proceeds without problems. As noted in [this issue](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/6), I do suggest removing the list of required packages from the README, as Bioconductor installs the dependencies without difficulty.\r\n- [x] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?\r\n  - Yes, I have confirmed that I can run the code provided in the vignette, and that it behaves as outlined in the vignette and paper.\r\n- [x] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)\r\n  - The paper has a performance claim that is not verified. See [this issue](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/8).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n  - This is stated in the paper, and in the package documentation, but not in the README. Copying over the statement from the DESCRIPTION should be sufficient. See [this issue](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/4).\r\n- [x] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.\r\n  - Dependencies are handled just fine by the Bioconductor installer.\r\n- [x] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).\r\n  - There is no example of usage in the README, but the included vignette does provide a fully worked example. I think including the commands listed in the package level documentation into the README would be sufficient. See [this issue](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/5).\r\n- [x] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?\r\n  - The core functionality is documented, in that there are descriptions for each function and their arguments.\r\n  - However, some of the documentation lacks examples, and there are places where I believe the documentation could be improved, as outlined in [this pull request](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/pull/3) and [this issue](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/9).\r\n- [x] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the function of the software can be verified?\r\n  - There are automated tests.\r\n- [x] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software 3) Seek support\r\n  - No Contributing file or description provided. See [this issue](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/strandCheckR/issues/7)\r\n\r\n### Software paper\r\n\r\n- [x] **Authors:** Does the `paper.md` file include a list of authors with their affiliations?\r\n- [x] **A statement of need:** Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?\r\n- [x] **References:** Do all archival references that should have a DOI list one (e.g., papers, datasets, software)?\r\n",
