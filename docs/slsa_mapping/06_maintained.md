# Consolidated Mapping of OpenSSF Scorecard Check to SLSA Threats

## Scorecard Check: Maintained

**Risk:** High

**Description:** This check determines whether the project is actively maintained. If the project is archived, it receives the lowest score. If there is at least one commit per week during the previous 90 days, the project receives the highest score. If there is activity on issues from users who are collaborators, members, or owners of the project, the project receives a partial score.
