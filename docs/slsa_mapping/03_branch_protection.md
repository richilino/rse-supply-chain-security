# Consolidated Mapping of OpenSSF Scorecard Check to SLSA Threats

## Scorecard Check: Branch Protection

**Risk:** High

**Description:** This check determines whether a project's default and release branches are protected with GitHub's branch protection or repository rules settings. Branch protection allows maintainers to define rules that enforce certain workflows for branches, such as requiring review or passing certain status checks before acceptance into a main branch, or preventing rewriting of public history.
