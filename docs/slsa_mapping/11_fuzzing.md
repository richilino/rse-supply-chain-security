# Consolidated Mapping of OpenSSF Scorecard Check to SLSA Threats

## Scorecard Check: Fuzzing

**Risk:** Medium

**Description:** Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is the practice of feeding unexpected or random data into a program to expose bugs. Regular fuzzing is important to detect vulnerabilities that may be exploited by others, especially since attackers can also use fuzzing to find the same flaws.
